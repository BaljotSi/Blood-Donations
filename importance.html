                <p>A blood donation occurs when a person voluntarily has blood drawn and used for transfusions and/or
                    made into
                    biopharmaceutical medications by a process called fractionation. Donation may be of whole blood, or
                    of
                    specific components directly. Blood banks often participate in the collection process as well as the
                    procedures that follow it.

                    Today in the developed world, most blood donors are unpaid volunteers who donate blood for a
                    community
                    supply. In some countries, established supplies are limited and donors usually give blood when
                    family or
                    friends need a transfusion. Many donors donate for several reasons, such as a form of charity,
                    general
                    awareness regarding the demand for blood, increased confidence in oneself, helping a personal friend
                    or
                    relative, and social pressure. Despite the many reasons that people donate, not enough potential
                    donors
                    actively donate. However, this is reversed during disasters when blood donations increase, often
                    creating an
                    excess supply that will have to be later discarded. In countries that allow paid donation some
                    people are
                    paid, and in some cases there are incentives other than money such as paid time off from work.
                    People can
                    also have blood drawn for their own future use. Donating is relatively safe, but some donors have
                    bruising
                    where the needle is inserted or may feel faint.

                    Potential donors are evaluated for anything that might make their blood unsafe to use. The screening
                    includes testing for diseases that can be transmitted by a blood transfusion, including HIV and
                    viral
                    hepatitis. The donor must also answer questions about medical history and take a short physical
                    examination
                    to make sure the donation is not hazardous to his or her health. How often a donor can donate varies
                    from
                    days to months based on what component they donate and the laws of the country where the donation
                    takes
                    place. For example, in the United States, donors must wait 56 days (eight weeks) between whole-blood
                    donations.

                    The amount of blood drawn and the methods vary. The collection can be done manually or with
                    automated
                    equipment that takes only specific components of the blood. Most of the components of blood used for
                    transfusions have a short shelf life, and maintaining a constant supply is a persistent problem.
                    This has
                    led to some increased interest in autotransfusion, whereby a patient's blood is salvaged during
                    surgery for
                    continuous reinfusionâ€”or alternatively, is "self-donated" prior to when it will be needed.</p>
